# ptonppl â€” Princeton People

This provides a Python package and a command-line tool to lookup the
campus directory of any member of the Princeton community. The package
provides a unified search function that queries the following fields:
- PUID, *e.g.*, `902312554`
- NetID, *e.g.*, `lumbroso`
- Alias, when the user has defined one, *e.g.*, `jeremie.lumbroso`
- Email, *e.g.*, `lumbroso@princeton.edu`

This information is hard to come by consistently, and this tool seeks
to provide a robust interface to the information.

## Installation

The package is distributed on PyPI and can be installed using the usual
tools, such as `pip` or `pipenv`:
```shell
$ pip install --user ptonppl
```
